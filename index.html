          <p>
            Hello! I'm a user-centric Product Manager with a proven track record of
            developing and shipping multiple products and services via science-based methodologies and
            operational analysis. During my career I've become proficient at translating and driving stakeholder
            needs into solutions with modern user and market research, detailed roadmapping,
            and release management processes. I am active in mentorship and training utilizing empathy, trust-building, and reducing
            bias.

      <div class="skills-grid">
        <div class="skill-card fade-in">
          <h3>Vision & Strategy</h3>
          <p>
            Product vision and strategy are foundational elements of a product's conception. I set strong product visions to ignite
            passion for the future, and provide purpose to all involved in bringing the product to life. A well-defined strategy
            helps to establish organizational alignment and focus for effective and efficient product development.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-card fade-in">
          <h3>User Research</h3>
          <p>
            Users are the core of any product, and I believe researching their needs and problems ensures solutions stay contextual
            to the user. Combining empathetic, user-centric design with empirical research means we can deliver real value to
            customers and reduce waste. Adhering to these principles helps us to define and build a product that meets the needs of
            the business, and delights users.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-card fade-in">
          <h3>Process & Prioritization</h3>
          <p>
            My product development process focuses on multiple steps, including defining solution-focused feature requirements,
            crafting meaningful user stories with acceptance criteria, intuitively-designed user flows and data-driven product
            plans. My skills in prioritization help to determine the time and effort needed to release a product and the rationale
            behind those decisions. The product roadmap that results is the vehicle that communicates a timeline for delivery,
            leading to more accurate cost planning.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-card fade-in">
          <h3>Refine & Collaborate</h3>
          <p>
            Ultimately, products are intended to solve a problem or fulfill a need, and I regularly evaluate whether or not a
            product is achieving its purpose. I embrace iterative, collaborative techniques that continuously gather feedback from
            users and internal voices, set strong KPIs that allow for quantitative value measures, and thoughtfully deprecate
            features. Dual-track agile and lean methodologies lend themselves well to this philosophy.

                I had the privilege of working with Stephanie at Sojern. She was my
                Account Manager on a multi-million dollar account,
                one of the largest, if not the largest, accounts that our company had at
                the time. She was thorough, thoughtful,
                professional, and brought outside the box ideas to grow the partnership.
                Stephanie is a superstar, and our clients loved
                working with her. Stephanie is a fantastic team player, and I hope to get
                to work with her again in the future.

                Stephanie was an excellent, invaluable part of our product team and a
                total pleasure to work with. As one of the very
                first product managers at Sojern, she helped the product org grow from
                just a few people to over 20 PMs over the course
                of 4 years, and her passion for her work, her spirit, and her general
                ethos helped give shape to the company's product
                DNA to this day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having worked very closely with Stephanie throughout my time at Sojern,
                it's genuinely hard to list out everything she
                contributed to. At the highest level, she took on some of the most
                daunting, challenging product problems and always
                came out on top – through her grace, poise, and pure smarts, Stephanie put
                her heart and energy into making products
                that fueled the core of Sojern's growth from $10MM to $150MM+ annual
                revenue. No matter what sort of obstacles presented
                themselves, she pushed through and met them with success, very frequently
                bringing cross-functional teams along with
                her.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond her contributions to actual products she designed, delivered, and
                grew, Stephanie was a notable part of our
                product org's culture and that of the company more broadly. I loved
                working with her most because she was constantly
                learning and challenged others to do the same; she regularly asked
                questions, spoke up, challenged the status quo, and
                constructively tackled hard situations head on. She was also extremely
                caring and passionate about the people she worked
                with, be it directly in her cross-functional teams or others spread across
                the company. She helped several people
                explore the world of product, regularly mentored junior employees through
                their new career paths, actively contributed
                to company culture, and took often sizable chunks out of her personal time
                to help others work through the ups and downs
                of a growing business.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any company looking for a strong willed, whip smart, deeply empathetic
                product leader would be fortunate to have
                Stephanie on their team!

                I worked with Stephanie for 3 years at Sojern. She is an amazing coworker and it is simply fantastic to work with her.
                She is an incredible listener with great communication and she is extremely efficient working cross-functional as she is
                can quickly identify the needs or issues of all the teams she works with. She is also an incredible problem-solver,
                always going out of her way to make sure everybody has a voice and all the right solutions are considered before picking
                the best one.

                I worked with Stephanie at Sojern for nearly five years through various
                roles. Stephanie mentored me throughout my
                journey teaching me invaluable professional and life skills. While
                Stephanie was a Product Manager she voluntarily took
                extra time to train me on basics related to product management, including
                writing effective user stories, specifications
                for software development and working in an agile framework. Her mentorship
                enabled me to excel and earn several
                promotions into my role today. Stephanie also taught me the importance of
                listening to understand, which is especially
                important with end users as they navigate through times of change. Through
                observation and mini lessons, she taught me
                how to effectively flex my communication depending on what stakeholder
                group I am talking to, be it other product
                managers, end users, engineers, leadership, etc. to execute on resolving a
                problem. This included having tough
                conversations when stakeholder groups are in disagreement on the best path
                forward. Stephanie is a valuable coworker who
                is ready to go all in to understand and resolve a problem, dependable in
                following through with work that needs to be
                done and committed to making the company/business move forward.

                teammates, to collaborating on various projects, Stephanie has always
                offered a helping hand or simply an ear as a

                mentor to me which has directly correlated to my
